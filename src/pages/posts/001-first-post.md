Here is my first week of Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs.

In just a few years, the number of applications using AI has grown tremendously, from self-driving cars to recommendations from your favorite streaming provider and chatbot.

Almost every major research field is now using AI. Behind all this, there is one technology called deep learning.
Before getting started further we should know what is deep learning exactly? What makes it so special?
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes to humans naturally: learn by doing & example. In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound.

For example, Home assistance devices that respond to your voice and know your preferences are powered by deep learning applications.

What is a Deep Learning Framework?
A Deep Learning Framework is an interface, library, or a tool which allows us to build deep learning models more easily and quickly, without getting into the details of underlying algorithms.
Example: — PyTorch, TensorFlow, Sonnet, etc.
In this guide, I’d like to tell you about what is PyTorch and 5 interesting functions related to PyTorch tensors.
Let's get started,
PyTorch:
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR).
The process of training a neural network is simple and clear. At the same time, PyTorch supports the data parallelism and distributed learning model, and also contains many pre-trained models.

Tensor:-
PyTorch is a Python package that provides Tensor computations. Tensors are multidimensional arrays just like NumPy's & arrays which can run on GPU as well.
If you’re wondering how to install PyTorch on your machine, check the installation steps of PyTorch for your machine here.
